# Hangman Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game. The game randomly selects a word from a list of four programming languages and the player has to guess the letters of the word before running out of attempts.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js installed in your system to run this game.

## How to play

To play the game, run the following command:

```
node hangman.js
```

You will be prompted to type "play" to start the game, "results" to see the scoreboard, and "exit" to quit. If you choose to play, you will be given a hidden word to guess and you have to input letters to uncover the word. If you guess a letter that is not in the word, you lose an attempt. If you run out of attempts, you lose the game.
